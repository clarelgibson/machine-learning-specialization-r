# Machine Learning in R

This repository contains worked examples in R of the machine learning algorithms covered in Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) available on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org).

## Description

In February 2025 I enrolled into the Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera. The course is jointly offered by [Stanford](https://www.coursera.org/partners/stanford) and [DeepLearning.ai](https://www.coursera.org/partners/deeplearning-ai) and the principal instructor is Stanford professor [Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng). It is a great introduction to some of the most commonly used machine learning algorithms. In order for me to fully understand all of the concepts taught in the course, I felt that I needed to work through my own examples. While the course is taught using python, I chose to use R for this exercise, both because it's a language I am more familiar with and because it forces me to think and write the code for myself, rather than copy the code used in the lectures.
